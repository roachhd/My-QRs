##My To Do list for this shiz

- Maybe add these as seperate gists and then display as single pages 

- Or set up a page to display all the codes (or game thumbnail), click on the thumbnails- or platform icon and that brings up the correct QR.

- Add document bootstrap as the gh-pages to display QRs (easy to work with) 

- Prob Cosmo or flatly theme
